## What This App Is

Note Vision is a fully offline Flutter mobile app for Optical Music Recognition (OMR).
The user photographs printed sheet music, the app detects musical symbols using an on-device
TFLite YOLO model, reconstructs the symbols into a digital score, lets the user correct
mistakes in an editor, then exports or plays back the result. No internet. No server. Everything on-device.

**Target users:** Music students, teachers, musicians who want to digitize printed scores quickly.

**Platform:** Android + iOS (Flutter). Also builds for Linux desktop but mobile is primary.

## Pipeline — How the App Works

```
Camera / Gallery / MusicXML file
        ↓
1. Preprocessing
   BasicImagePreprocessor — grayscale, orientation-corrected, full resolution
        ↓
2. Staff Line Detection
   HorizontalProjectionStaffDetector — finds 5 line Y positions per stave
   Populates DetectedStaff.lineYs for pitch reconstruction
        ↓
3. Symbol Detection
   TfliteSymbolDetector — full image stretched to 640×640 (no tiling/letterbox)
   YOLO on-device int8, NMS, confidence 0.75 threshold
   combStaff detections → DetectedStaff (model-detected staves, preferred over projector)
   musical symbol detections → DetectedSymbol list
   SyntheticStaffBuilder fallback when neither source produces staves
        ↓
4. Reconstruction Pipeline
   StaffAssigner → MeasureGrouper → StemAssociator
   → SignatureInferrer → SemanticInferrer → PitchCalculator → ScoreBuilder
   One Part produced per detected staff (Treble, Bass, Staff N...)
   Returns ScoreModel
        ↓
5. Editor
   EditorShellScreen — CustomPainter notation viewer
   Symbol selection, pitch move, accidental toggle, delete, duration change,
   insert note/rest, drag-to-reorder, undo/redo (50 levels)
        ↓
6. Export / Playback  [Sprint 7]
   MusicXML export, PDF export, flutter_midi_pro audio playback
```

## Design System

All screens use the same dark theme. Never use light colors unless it is a notation canvas.

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Background | `0xFF0D0D0D` | Screen backgrounds |
| Surface | `0xFF1A1A1A` | Cards, panels, bottom sheets |
| Surface Alt | `0xFF161616` | Nested surfaces |
| Border | `0xFF2C2C2C` | All borders and dividers |
| Accent | `0xFFD4A96A` | Primary actions, highlights, selected state |
| Text Primary | `0xFFFFFFFF` | Main text |
| Text Secondary | `0xFF8A8A8A` | Subtitles, labels, hints |

---

## Key Decisions — Locked In

These are final unless explicitly changed:

- **Model input size:** 640×640 int8 — model is `assets/models/best_int8.tflite` (ticket 37 done)
- **Tiling strategy:** No tiling — full image always stretched to 640×640 (no letterbox, no stave-based cropping). Decided BGC-57: model was trained on full-page stretches.
- **Staff detection:** Two sources merged — model `combStaff` detections (preferred) + `HorizontalProjectionStaffDetector` supplement + `SyntheticStaffBuilder` fallback. `SyntheticStaffBuilder` uses notehead Y distribution to estimate staff geometry when no staves detected.
- **Notation renderer:** CustomPainter — not a text list, not an SVG library
- **Undo/redo:** Whole-state snapshot, max 50 entries, new edit clears redo stack
- **Insert default:** C4 quarter note / quarter rest, appended to end of selected measure, auto-selected after insert
- **Drag insert:** LongPressDraggable from palette → DragTarget on staff. Drop Y → pitch via PitchCalculator. Drop X → insert index.
- **PDF export:** `pdf` package with programmatic Canvas drawing — replicates CustomPainter logic
- **Audio playback:** `flutter_midi_pro` — synthesizes from Note step+octave+duration directly
- **Save/load:** JSON files in app documents directory via path_provider. Project index in shared_preferences.
- **MusicXML export:** `xml` package, valid MusicXML 3.1, shared via share_plus
- **Analytics:** Local only — scans, edits, exports, playbacks as integers in shared_preferences. No backend.
- **Username:** Name + profile photo. First-launch onboarding. Stored locally.
- **App is fully offline:** No network calls, no auth, no backend, ever.

## EditorState — How It Works

`EditorState` is immutable. Every edit returns a new instance via `copyWith`.

```dart
// Key fields
Score score                    // Current ScoreModel
int? selectedPartIndex         // Which part is selected (always 0 in Sprint 5)
int? selectedMeasureIndex      // Which measure is selected
int? selectedSymbolIndex       // Which symbol index is selected
ScoreSymbol? selectedSymbol    // The actual selected symbol object
List<EditorSnapshot> undoStack // Max 50 entries
List<EditorSnapshot> redoStack // Cleared on new edit
bool hasUnsavedChanges         // Set true on edit, false after save

// Key operations (all in editor_actions.dart)
applyEdit(score, ...)               // Push to undo stack + update state
undo()                              // Pop undo stack, push to redo stack
redo()                              // Pop redo stack, push to undo stack
moveSelectedSymbolUp/Down()         // Diatonic pitch move, preserves alter
setSelectedDuration(spec)           // No-op if same duration
setSelectedNoteAccidental(int?)     // null=none 1=♯ -1=♭ 0=♮; no-op for rests/same value
deleteSelectedSymbol()              // Keeps measure context for re-insert
insertNoteAfterSelection()          // Appends C4 quarter, auto-selects
insertRestAfterSelection()          // Appends quarter rest, auto-selects
reorderSymbolWithinMeasure()        // Cannot cross measure boundary
moveSelectedSymbolToMeasureOffset() // Move symbol to adjacent measure
```

## Reconstruction — What Works vs What Doesn't

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Single treble clef stave | ✅ Works |
| Multi-stave (one Part per staff) | ✅ Works — BGC-57 |
| Staff assignment | ✅ Works — model combStaff detections preferred, projector supplement, synthetic fallback |
| Measure grouping from barlines | ✅ Works |
| Note reconstruction (whole/half/quarter/eighth/sixteenth) | ✅ Works — noteheadBlack without stem assumed quarter (stems frequently missed by model) |
| Rest reconstruction (whole/half/quarter/eighth/sixteenth) | ✅ Works — BGC-59 |
| Pitch calculation from staff position | ✅ Works — treble + bass clef both supported |
| Stem/flag/beam association | ✅ Works — BGC-59 beams |
| Key signature | ✅ Works — accidental cluster count → fifths — BGC-59 |
| Time signature | ✅ Works — digit pair + common/cut — BGC-59 |
| Accidentals on individual notes | ✅ Works — proximity match to notehead — BGC-59 |
| Beamed eighth notes | ✅ Works — hasBeam flag on StemLink — BGC-59 |
| Bass clef (fClef) pitch reconstruction | ✅ Works — G2 base, _fromBassOffset — BGC-59 |
| SyntheticStaffBuilder fallback | ✅ Works — estimates staff from notehead Y distribution |
| Grand staff | ❌ Not supported |
| Chords | ❌ Not supported |
| Ties, slurs, tuplets | ❌ Not supported |

## What Is Not In Jira Yet

These were discussed and agreed but not yet added as tickets:

- Fix B1: Continue button enabled with no detections
- Fix B2: Import button → dedicated MusicXML import screen (user-facing, not just dev tool)
- Fix B3: Import JSON with DEV label on MusicXML import screen
- Fix B4: Score model debug preview dark background
- Fix B5: MusicXML inspector dark theme
- Staff line detection + removal pre-pass (between preprocessing and detection)
- Expand ticket 63 scope to include profile photo (already reflected above)
- Expand ticket 82 scope to be profile + stats combined screen

## What the App Cannot Do (Current Limits)

These are current limitations, not hard ceilings — going beyond them is fine if it makes the app better.

- Bass clef rendering ✅ done in editor; alto clef, tenor clef still unsupported
- Grand staff (two staves, piano LH+RH)
- Chords (multiple notes on one stem)
- Ties, slurs, tuplets, dotted rhythms
- Sixteenth notes or smaller
- Grace notes, ornaments
- Dynamics, articulations, tempo markings
- Repeat signs, D.C., D.S., coda
- Multiple voices on one staff
- Lyrics
- Handwritten music
- Multi-page score layout (Sprint 7 PDF wraps staves but single score only)
- Cloud sync, accounts, collaboration
- Any network call of any kind

## How to Use This File

At the start of a Claude session paste this file or reference it.
Claude can then ask you what ticket or feature to work on without needing the full codebase in context.
Update this file whenever:
- A ticket status changes
- A new decision is locked in
- A bug is found or fixed
- A new ticket is added
- A scope change happens

Do not let this file get stale — an outdated CONTEXT.md is worse than no CONTEXT.md.

claude and I can update this from time to time when changes are final

## MusicXML Save to Device — Delivery Notes (Sprint 6, branch claude/musicxml-export-feature-zwSqL)

- **`MusicXmlExportService.exportToDevice(Score) → Future<File>`** — new method alongside `exportAndShare`
  - Android: writes to Downloads folder via `getDownloadsDirectory()`, falls back to `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` if null
  - iOS: writes to app Documents directory, accessible via Files app under "On My iPhone"
  - Returns the saved `File` so callers can display the path
- **Editor header export button replaced with `PopupMenuButton`**
  - Two items: "Share…" (existing share sheet) and "Save to Device" (new direct save)
  - New `_ExportOption` enum and `_ExportMenuItem` widget added to `editor_shell_screen.dart`
- **SnackBar feedback** — on success shows full file path for 4 seconds; on failure shows error message
- All 124 tests pass

---

## BGC-62 Delivery Notes (Sprint 6, branch BGC-57 / 57-copy)

- **`setSelectedNoteAccidental(int? alter)`** added to `EditorActions` extension in `editor_actions.dart`
  - No-ops if not a Note, or if value is already the same (idempotent)
  - Preserves all other note fields; undo tracked automatically via `_replaceSelectedSymbol`
- **Accidental rendering in `ScoreNotationPainter._drawNote()`**
  - Draws `♯ ♭ ♮ 𝄪 𝄫` immediately left of the notehead using `TextPainter`
  - Positioned at `x - glyphWidth - 3px`, vertically centered on note Y
  - Applies to all notes with `alter != null` including double accidentals from reconstruction
- **ACCIDENTAL group added to `_InspectorPanel`** (between PITCH and DURATION)
  - 4 tiles: `— None · ♯ Sharp · ♭ Flat · ♮ Natural`
  - New `_AccTile` widget: same shape as `_DurTile` with `isActive` state
  - Active tile highlighted with accent color `Color(0xFFD4A96A)` background + border
  - Tiles disabled (greyed) when a Rest is selected or nothing is selected
  - Active tile auto-updates when selection changes to a different note
  - Tapping the active tile again is a no-op (direct select, not cycle toggle — better UX than spec)

---

## BGC-59 Delivery Notes (Sprint 6, branch BGC-59 merged into BGC-57)

Full expanded reconstruction pipeline. All spec criteria satisfied, several above scope:

- **Key signature** — `SignatureInferrer.inferKeySignature` counts leading accidentals → `KeySignature(fifths: ±count)`
- **Time signature** — digit pairs split by staff midpoint; `timeSigCommon`→4/4, `timeSigCutCommon`→2/2
- **Note-level accidentals** — `SemanticInferrer._matchAccidentalsToNoteheads` proximity-matches body accidentals to nearest notehead to the right; `SymbolClassifier.alterFor()` maps type → MusicXML alter value
- **Beamed eighth notes** — `StemAssociator._hasNearbyBeam` sets `StemLink.hasBeam`; `SemanticInferrer._buildNote` treats `hasBeam || hasFlag` → `'eighth'`
- **Bass clef pitch** — `PitchCalculator._fromBassOffset` with G2 as bottom-line base
- **Expanded rest types** — `rest8th` → `'eighth'`, `rest16th` → `'sixteenth'`
- **Double accidentals** — `isAnyAccidental` + `alterFor` handle `accidentalDoubleSharp`/`accidentalDoubleFlat` (above spec)
- **`expanded_reconstruction_test.dart`** — 13 new tests across 4 groups: accidentals (5), beams (3), rests (2), bass clef (3)
- **Sprint 4 test fixes** (3 tests) — updated for BGC-57 multi-part behavior: part name `'Detected Part'` → `'Treble'`; multi-staff test updated from `parts.single` to asserting two parts with correct content

## noteheadBlack Stem Assumption Heuristic (post-BGC-59, branch BGC-57)

Implemented in `SemanticInferrer._buildNote()`:

- **Problem:** YOLO frequently misses stems (thin vertical lines). A `noteheadBlack` with no detected stem was silently dropped — the note disappeared entirely from the reconstructed score.
- **Fix:** Added a terminal fallback case `'noteheadBlack' => 'quarter'` in the `_buildNote` switch. When no stem is detected alongside a black notehead, the note is assumed to be a quarter note rather than discarded.
- **Rationale:** A slightly-wrong duration (quarter instead of eighth/quarter) is far less damaging than a missing note. Pitch reconstruction is unaffected.
- **Note still dropped if:** pitch calculation fails (e.g., no clef in the measure) — that guard is independent of this heuristic.
- **Switch order (in priority):**
  1. `noteheadBlack` with stem + flag/beam → eighth
  2. `noteheadBlack` with stem (no flag/beam) → quarter
  3. `noteheadBlack` with beam but no stem → eighth (beams are thicker, easier for model to detect than thin stems)
  4. `noteheadBlack` (no stem, no beam) → quarter ← fallback
- **Test impact:** Two tests in `detection_to_score_mapper_service_test.dart` updated:
  - "ambiguous noteheads" — now asserts 1 quarter note produced (clef present, pitch succeeds); previously expected empty symbols + "Could not infer" warning
  - "partial mapped score" — now asserts empty symbols with "Could not calculate pitch" warning (clef absent → pitch fails after switch succeeds); previously expected empty symbols + "Could not infer" warning

## BGC-57 Delivery Notes (Sprint 6, branch BGC-57)

Real TFLite detection connected to reconstruction pipeline end-to-end. Major changes:

- **`TfliteSymbolDetector` — single inference path**: full image always stretched to 640×640, no tiling, no letterboxing. `_parseOutput` uses normalized (0–1) XYXY coords, scales back via `origW/640 × origH/640`.
- **Detection overlay fix (`DetectionOverlay`)**: `LayoutBuilder` computes `scaleX = displayW / imageW`, `scaleY = displayH / imageH`; all `Positioned` coordinates multiplied by scale factors. Fixes misalignment caused by `InteractiveViewer(constrained: true)` squeezing child to viewport size while overlay used raw pixel coords.
- **`DetectionOverlay` params**: now requires `imageWidth` and `imageHeight`; `_StaffOverlay` receives `scaleX`/`scaleY`.
- **`_mergeStaves`**: model combStaff detections preferred; HorizontalProjectionStaffDetector staves used as supplement only when model missed a staff.
- **`SyntheticStaffBuilder`**: estimates staff geometry from notehead Y distribution when neither source produces staves.
- **Multi-part pipeline in `DetectionToScoreMapperService`**: iterates all staves, produces one `Part` per staff (`'Treble'`, `'Bass'`, `'Staff N'`). `ScoreBuilder.buildPart()` and `buildFromParts()` added.
- **`MappingResult.staffSource`**: `'synthetic'` when SyntheticStaffBuilder was used, null otherwise.
- **`ScoreNotationViewer`** updated to render multi-part scores (one staff row per part).
- **`EditorShellScreen`** updated for multi-part `Score` structure.

## BGC-60 Delivery Notes (Sprint 6, branch BGC-55-56)

- **`MusicXmlExportService`** — new file `lib/features/musicXML/musicxml_export_service.dart`
  - `toMusicXml(Score)` — pure function, returns valid MusicXML 3.1 string (no I/O, fully unit-testable)
  - `exportAndShare(Score)` — writes `.musicxml` to temp dir, opens system share sheet via `share_plus`
  - Builds: `<work>`, `<identification>` (with `<encoding>`), `<part-list>`, `<part>` → `<measure>` → `<attributes>` (on first measure or when clef/key/time present) → `<note>` / `<rest>`
  - `divisions` hardcoded to `2` (matching our quarter=2 convention); `alter` omitted when null or 0
  - `voice` and `staff` elements emitted only when present on the model
  - XML DOCTYPE header prepended manually (xml package doesn't support DOCTYPE nodes)
  - `_safeFileName` replaces non-word characters with underscores for safe file naming
- **Export button wired into editor** — `_EditorHeader` originally had a single `ios_share_rounded` icon, later replaced by a `PopupMenuButton` with "Share…" and "Save to Device" (see Save to Device delivery notes)
- **`share_plus: ^12.0.2` added** to pubspec (resolved by `flutter pub add` due to web package conflict with file_picker)
- **Landing screen test fix** — `Pressing Get Started navigates to CollectionScreen` required `SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues({'onboarding_complete': true})` because `UserProfileService.isOnboardingComplete()` reads SharedPreferences asynchronously
- **`!mounted` / `this.context` pattern** — `landing_screen.dart` now correctly guards async gap with `State.mounted` (`if (!mounted) return`) then uses `this.context` (State's own context), not `context.mounted` on the parameter

## BGC-55-56 Delivery Notes (Sprint 6, branch BGC-55-56)

Shipped beyond the ticket spec:

- **Editor UI full redesign** — new header, floating controls, landscape side panel, portrait bottom panel, `_SelectionCard`, `_ActionTile`, animated mode pill
- **Insert mode** — tap palette item to enter insert mode, tap canvas to place symbol at that exact position; tap same item again exits insert mode
- **Bass clef rendering** — `ScoreNotationPainter` now renders F-clef with dots; `StaffPitchMapper` is clef-aware (G/F); key signature accidental positions also clef-aware
- **Eighth note duration fix** — `eighthDuration` was `DurationSpec('eighth', 1)` matching quarter — corrected to distinct value; all DurationSpec constants now: whole=8, half=4, quarter=2, eighth=1
- **`insertSymbolAtMeasureIndex`** — new `EditorActions` method for precise index-targeted insert (used by canvas drop and insert mode)
